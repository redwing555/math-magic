      Even though everyone learns mathematics at school, it is difficult
      to define exactly what mathematics is. Clearly numbers, shapes and
      equations form part of it, but only a small part compared to the vast
      space of mathematical concepts and ideas. The best way to understand what
      mathematics is and what mathematicians work on â€“ is to do mathematics.

    <p className="intro">
      One idea that appears everywhere in mathematics is abstraction.
      Instead of thinking about particular numbers, shapes, equations or any other objects,
      mathematicians tend to think about their underlying structures and patterns.
      This means that the results, called Theorems, are more general and provide deeper insight.
